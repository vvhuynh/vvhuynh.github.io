## 🚀 Projects

### AI Copilot for Decentralized Collaboration Platform
* Engineered a context-aware AI assistant using OpenAI GPT-4o, React, and Flask, implementing real-time state injection to synchronize the LLM with active canvas metadata (object counts, user activity) for intelligent, domain-specific support.
* Built a secure “Tool Calling” execution pipeline to translate natural language into distributed system actions, orchestrating immutable state updates across MongoDB, Redis, and ResilientDB to enable idempotent, hands-free canvas management.

### Edge Medical LLM with Socratic Reasoning
* Engineered an offline “Edge First Aid” LLM by fine-tuning Qwen-1.5B with 4-bit QLoRA and Knowledge Distillation, achieving a 14% BLEU score improvement over the baseline while maintaining a 31-second latency on consumer hardware.
* Conducted a comparative analysis of three model configurations, determining that SFT provided the optimal edge solution by balancing semantic fidelity and throughput (13.8 tokens/sec) compared to expensive tree-search reasoning.

### AI Grocery Shopping Agent | NVIDIA Agentic AI Hackathon
* Developed a multi-agent AI system using LangChain, NVIDIA’s Llama 3.3 70B model, and NeMo Agent Toolkit to coordinate LLM-based agents for real-time grocery list generation, pricing optimization, and conversational cooking assistance
* Built a Flask backend and integrated REST APIs to handle dynamic user input, prompt engineering, and multi-objective decision-making, with a modern web interface enabling interactive agentic behavior and real-time reasoning.

### Real-Time Hand Tracking & Gesture-Based Mouse Control
* Designed and delivered a hands-on workshop teaching real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe and OpenCV, enabling participants to build gesture-based cursor control systems.
* Demonstrated integration of computer vision with PyAutoGUI to translate hand landmarks into mouse movements and implement clock actions using fingertip distance detection.

### Cloud Run Guestbook App
* Developed and containerized a Flask-based guestbook app, deploying it to Google Cloud Run for automatic scaling and serverless execution.
* Integrated Cloud SQL for persistent message storage and implemented a CI/CD pipeline, reducing deployment time by 70% with automated container builds.

### Garbage Classification ML Model
* Trained and fine-tuned a CNN-based image classifier using TensorFlow/Keras to identify 7 waste types with 92% validation accuracy; improved model performance by 15% through data augmentation and preprocessing.
* Deployed model to Hugging Face Hub for public access and integration into smart bin or PoC applications, with built-in Grad-CAM explainability for real-time interpretability and trust in predictions.

### Customer Service Chatbot & Ticketing System
* Developed a GPT-2 fine-tuned chatbot with 90%+ accuracy on customer service queries, reducing response time and automating support for over 1,000 common queries.
* Built a ticket submission system integrated with a PostgreSQL database, managing over 500 customer tickets monthly for seamless issue escalation and employee tracking.

### TCP Socket Client-Server Application
* Developed a TCP-based client-server system in C++ that encodes messages up to 256 characters, achieving a 98% data transmission reliability rate in testing across multiple client-server connections.
* Enhanced system stability with comprehensive error handling, supporting up to 50 message transactions per second and reducing message encoding errors by 95% through real-time validation at each transmission stage.
